## Specification

You should implement an application that receives call detail records
and calculates monthly bills for a given telephone number.

There are a plenty of telecommunications platform technologies that will
consume this application. Some of them have weird behaviours when something
goes wrong. That said it's not safe to believe in received data correctness,
consistency nor expect some order in their requests. The application should
have flexibility in receiving information to avoid record loss or inconsistency.

This application must provide a HTTP REST API to attend the
requirements.
